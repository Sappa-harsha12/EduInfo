<p><strong>Education is empowering and redefining</strong>. For hundreds of millions of the young in India, education is also about discipline, development, curiosity, creativity and a path to breaking the cycle of ignorance and poverty leading to employment and prosperity. Indiaâ€™s demographic dividend depends on the learning level of students. The quality of education has a direct bearing on any economy.</p>

<p>Education is a significant step to achieving all other basic human rights. Education can help decrease poverty, reduce social inequalities, empower women and others marginalised, bring down discrimination and finally help individuals live life to their fullest potentials. It helps improve access to opportunities for a better life in terms of employment and business. It can also bring about peace and overall prosperity to a region. Therefore, education is one of the most important rights.</p>

<h1>Status of Education in India</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Indian education and social arrangements are very inflexible on kids and completely ignore their feelings, thoughts and ambitions. Kids are pressed to study from the age of 3. Non-performers are treated as dunces and detested by parents and society.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As per&nbsp;<strong>UNESCO data</strong>, India has one of the lowest public expenditure rates on education per student, especially compared to other Asian countries like China.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Education in most schools is one dimensional, with an obsessive focus on marks. Added to this is the lack of availability of trained teachers at all levels. Quality teachers are the missing link in the Indian education system. Although pockets of excellence exist, the quality of teaching, especially in government schools, does not meet the standards.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a literacy rate of 77 percent, India lags behind other BRICS nations, which have literacy rates above 90 percent. All these countries have better student-teacher ratios. So not only does India grapple with poor quality teachers, it also has fewer total teachers in comparison with other countries that do a better job at education.</p>

<p>Data from the Ministry of Human Resource Development show that only half of all students who enter primary school make it to the upper primary level and less than half that get into the 9-12 class cycle.</p>

<p>Study after study has shown that the true indicator of economic development in a country is the education and wellbeing of its people. Although, India has made rapid economic progress over the last three decades, one area that has not received enough attention is the quality of primary education.</p>
